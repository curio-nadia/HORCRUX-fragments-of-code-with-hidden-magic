# HORCRUX-fragments-of-code-with-hidden-magic
Curio-Nadia’s first repository, named after a relic from the Harry Potter series. As a newbie, I couldn’t think of a better name than one inspired by the book I just finished reading. This repo holds fragments of my curiosity, experiments, and the magic of starting something new.
